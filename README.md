#Charges-App

Hi, this is the charges application

Charges Application is an application created to facilitate employee organization hours. I used ReactJS (Redux) and Node as the main stack (Express/GraphQL for backend/API and Knex for database queries). Employees can register as they want and can add their weekly work hours inside the system.

Deployment: Git, GitHub, Docker for containerization and DigitalOcean.

<h1>Suggestions</h1>

<ul>
	<li>You can register/login by normal form or by google oauth</li>
	<li>If you don't want to register into the site, then you can use the pre-registered account below</li>
	<li>Charges and locations must have the same number of days or you will not be able to confirm the charge for that date</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pre-registered account</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Email: root@company.com</li>
	<li>Password: root1234</li>
</ul>
